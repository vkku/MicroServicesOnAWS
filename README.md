## Introduction 

This course serves as an introduction to running various services on AWS.  We show how these "microservices" can be stitched together to make a working application. Going through this course will give you an idea of what a "Full Stack" developer does.  You will be configuring services and writing code.  

Our application is a simple photo album complete with object recognition.

## Architecture

Our architecture looks as follows:

### Front End Services
![arch04](images/arch04.png)
We use s3 static hosting with cloudfront, S3, and certificates. 

### Client APIs
![arch01 ](images/arch01.png)
When the browser downloads the application, it calls three different APIs: Cognito, S3, and our API Gateway. 

### Backend System
![arch02](images/arch02.png)
We use the [serverless](https://serverless.com) project to create our API Gateway and Lambdas.  We also use DynamoDB to store metadata.

### Object Recognition 
![arch03](images/arch03.png)
Once images are uploaded, we can do object detection on them to find things inside of them. AI!
